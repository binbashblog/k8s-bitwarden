# k8s bitwarden deployment

Uses the official bitwarden docker images instead of the 3rd party rust implementation

##Requirements
Docker 18.06.2-ce
Kubernetes v1.12.5

I first install the docker image on a machine running centos 7 to get the bwdata directory file structure and the configs the bitwarden pytrhon script generates which I then copy to a nfs server. I copy the contents of the env files to the configmap.yaml file in yaml format and define that configmap in every container so they get the env variables at runtime. You will also need the identity.pfx and the encrypted password and ssh keys generated by the bitwarden script, hence why it's better to set up bitwarden using the official docker script and then just take the file structure and copy it.
